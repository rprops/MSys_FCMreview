# Computational Analysis of Microbial Flow Cytometry Data

This repository accompanies the minireview [Computational Analysis of Microbial Flow Cytometry Data](https://msystems.asm.org/content/6/1/e00895-20), published in mSystems. 

## Workflow demonstration

Here,  you can find a [demo](https://github.com/rprops/MSys_FCMreview/blob/master/Demo.html) of a flow cytometry bioinformatics pipeline tailored towards microbial data. It includes preprocessing, visualization, cytometric fingerprinting and ecological inferences (&alpha;- and $beta;-diversity). Note that such a pipeline can differ at many locations. We aim to provide an example on how to automate the data analysis pipeline, not to provide a single best solution. 

We used an external dataset, published by [Liu and colleagues (2018)](https://msphere.asm.org/content/3/1/e00564-17). Note that the dataset is too large to add to this repository, but it can be freely downloaded via [FlowRepository](http://flowrepository.org/FR-FCM-ZZTV) using the identifier _FR-FCM-ZZTV_.
